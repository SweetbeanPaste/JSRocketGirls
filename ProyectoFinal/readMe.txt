=> This is a very basic Card like game that uses DOM to manipulate events.

Can do:
1. Selent 3 cards for your deck, the remaining will automatically be assing to the enemy deck.
2. Once playe clicks "ready" it will calculate the respective total stats of player and enemy.
3. Will reveal who the winner is base on the stats.
4. You might alter the stats of your cards in the "about" section, where you can also get a bit of each entity lore.

Point to improve:
1. The code might not be as tidy as expected, and some functions may look a lot alike.
it could use some modulatity to reuse certain processes and shorten functions.
2. Saving a deck is done using "localStorage", there is probably a better method such as using node.js 
3. The naming could be more solid, for instante either use "_" or camelCase but NOT both.
4. The game could use a restart button to start another game once finished, instead of refreshing the page.
5. I was not aware using "px" would make the page stiff when adapting to screen.
